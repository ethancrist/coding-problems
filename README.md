# Daily Coding Problems
[dailycodingproblem.com](https://dailycodingproblem.com) has a mailing list to which they send one coding problem per day.

Every time a new problem comes out, this repository will be updated.

## Problem 1

Given a list of numbers and a number `k` of `17`, return whether any of two of the numbers from the `list` add up to `k`.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17` return `true` since `10 + 7` is `17`.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## Problem 2

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
